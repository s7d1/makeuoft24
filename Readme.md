###Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project stems from the versatility found in military garages, where turrets of a tank can be effortlessly swapped to adapt to various situations. We aimed to bring this modular concept to everyday lawn care, envisioning a versatile lawn rover that can seamlessly switch between different functionality modules.

###What it does
Our modular lawn rover is designed to revolutionize lawn care and yardwork. With its interchangeable modules, it can perform a myriad of tasks, from mowing the lawn to handling other essential yardwork duties. This innovative approach not only enhances efficiency but also provides users with a customizable solution for their specific needs.

###How we built it
The foundation of our rover lies in a laser-cut chassis, providing a robust yet lightweight structure. The brain behind its operations is an Arduino, allowing for a flexible and programmable control system. The combination of precision engineering and intelligent control forms the backbone of our modular lawn rover.

###Challenges we ran into
During the development process, we encountered several challenges. Firstly the Qualcomm HDK 8450 didn't have much documentation available online so we had to use trial and error to figure out how it worked. The Bluetooth module on the Arduino faced connectivity issues, requiring us to delve deep into troubleshooting. Additionally, we grappled with malfunctioning motors, demanding meticulous repair work. Overcoming these challenges tested our problem-solving skills and resilience, ultimately leading to a functional rover.

###Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the hurdles, we are proud to announce that our rover runs successfully! This achievement signifies our team's dedication and perseverance. Witnessing the tangible outcome of our efforts motivates us to continue pushing the boundaries of modular lawn care solutions.

###What we learned
The journey of creating this modular lawn rover provided us with invaluable insights into Arduino utilities and hardware intricacies. We deepened our understanding of how to integrate different components seamlessly, fostering a wealth of knowledge in robotics and electronics.

###What's next for Modular Lawn Rover
Our vision extends beyond the current functionality. The next phase of development involves implementing autonomous navigation, elevating the rover's capabilities to new heights. We aim to make lawn care even more effortless by allowing the rover to navigate and perform tasks independently.
